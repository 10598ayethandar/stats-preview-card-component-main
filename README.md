## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
  In this solution, I learned a new some code "display:flex,flex-direction:column;".
  from flexbox lessons.

```css
body{
        width:1440px;
        min-height: 100vh;
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: center;
        background-color:  hsl(233, 47%, 7%);
        color:white;
    }
}
```

### Useful resources
